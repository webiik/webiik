# Webiik
Just another PHP micro-framework and framework.

__Why?__<br/>
Because it fits my needs and always will be.

__Why open source?__<br/>
Iâ€™m nice person and my clients can use my work even with other developers.

__Is it secure?__<br/>
I hope so, but if you discover some vulnerability within Webiik, please send me an email at jiri@mihal.me.
