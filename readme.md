# Webiik
From [indie hacker](https://mihal.me) for [indie hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com), [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) framework for quick creation of websites and web apps. Stop learning over bloated frameworks and start creating now.

[Core documentation](core.md)

## Webiik Skeleton
Everything what modern website or web app needs. You can focus just on your project.
